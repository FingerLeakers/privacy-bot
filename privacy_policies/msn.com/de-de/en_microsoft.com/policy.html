    Xbox consoles are hardware devices that you can use to access and play games, movies, music, and other forms of digital entertainment. Xbox Live (including Games for Windows Live) is Microsoft's online gaming and entertainment service and social network. It provides ways for you to connect with your friends on Xbox Live and other gaming and social networks. Xbox services can be accessed from a variety of devices, including Xbox consoles, PCs (including via xbox.com and the Xbox app), and mobile devices.&#13;
</p><p>We collect data about your use of Xbox services, such as:</p><ul><li>When you sign in and sign out, the games you play, your game and score statistics, and the purchases you make and content you obtain. </li><li>Performance data about the Xbox services, your device and your network connection, including any hardware or software errors that occur. </li><li>If you use the Xbox console with Kinect, data about how you use Kinect. See below for more information about Kinect data collection. </li></ul><p>&#13;
    All such data is stored with the Xbox console's unique identifier and associated with your personal data. When your Xbox is connected to the Internet, we identify which console and which version of the Xbox operating system you are currently using.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
    With your consent, we will collect information about videos you purchase or view through third-party apps on your Xbox console. If you use the Xbox TV app, we collect TV viewing history from your console in a way that doesn't identify you or others.&#13;
</p><p>&#13;
    If you use an Xbox console that includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), and if you play offline or have never signed into the services on the console, usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time you sign into the services.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live data viewable by other users. </strong>Your gamertag (Xbox live nickname), game and score statistics, achievements, presence (whether you're signed into Xbox Live), and other data about your activity on Xbox Live can be seen by other users on Xbox Live or other properties associated with Xbox Live (including those of partner companies). For example, your gamertag and scores that show on game leaderboards are considered public and can't be hidden. For other types of data, you can adjust your privacy settings on the console or at&#13;
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/">xbox.com</a> to limit or block the sharing with other users.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live data shared with game or app publishers. </strong>When you use an Xbox Live-enabled game or app, the publisher or service provider for that game or app has access to data about your usage of Xbox Live and that game or app, and may disclose or display (such as on leaderboards) such data. This data includes, for example, your game scores, data about your game play sessions (for example, types of vehicles used in the game), your presence on Xbox Live, the time you spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, and other content that you may create or submit within the game or app.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Linking your Xbox Live account to non-Microsoft accounts.</strong> Some of the games or apps found on Xbox Live are delivered by partner companies, which may require that you create a non-Microsoft account and sign-in credentials to use that game or app. If you choose to link your Microsoft account with your account with a partner company, Microsoft will share limited account information with that company. Such account information can include name, address, email and date of birth but will not include any credit card or other payment information. For games that enable in-game communications, the game publisher will also have access to the content of in-game communications when you are signed into your account with the publisher.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Kinect.</strong> The Kinect sensor is a combination of camera, microphone, and infrared sensor that can enable motions and voice to be used to control gameplay and to navigate through the service. For example:&#13;
</p><ul><li>If you choose, the camera can be used to sign you into the service automatically using facial recognition. To do this it takes an image of your face and measures distances between key points to create and store a numeric value that represents only you. This data stays on the console and is not shared with anyone, and you can choose to delete this data from your console at any time.</li><li>For gameplay, Kinect will map distances between your body's joints to create a stick figure representation of you that helps Kinect enable gameplay. If you are playing online, we collect those numeric values to enable and improve gameplay and the gaming experience. Kinect also detects specific hand gestures intended to do simple system interactions (such as menu navigation, pan/zoom and scroll). </li><li>For some fitness games, Xbox can use the Kinect sensor to estimate your exercise data, including estimates such as your heart rate during a certain activity or the number of calories burned during a workout. </li><li>Kinect's microphones enable voice chat between players during gameplay. They also enable voice commands for control of the console, game or app,Â or to enter search terms. See below for additional details on voice data collection. </li><li>The Kinect sensor can also be used for audio and video communications through services such as&#13;

</p><p><strong>Captioning.</strong> During Xbox real-time chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio in-game chat as text. If a user activates this feature, the other players will have no additional notice. Microsoft uses this data to provide captioning of chat for users who need it. We also use this data to improve our ability to provide the service and other, similar voice-based services.</p><p><strong>CommunicationsÂ monitoring.</strong> Xbox Live includes communications features such as text-based messaging and online voice chat between players during gameplay. In order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the&#13;
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct">Microsoft Code of Conduct</a>, we will collect, review, and monitor a sample of these communications, including Xbox Live game chats and party chat communications in live-hosted multiplayer gameplay sessions offered through the services.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Voice data for service improvement. </strong>We collect, and use for service improvement, voice search requests or samples of voice commandsÂ occurring while using Kinect.Â These data are stored separately from your Xbox profile.&#13;
</p><p><strong>GameDVR.</strong> Any player in a multiplayer game session can use GameDVR to record their view of the gameplay taking place in that session. The recording can capture your in-game character and gamertag in the game clips created by other players in the gameplay session. Note that if a player uses GameDVR on a PC, audio chat may also be captured in a game clip. Microsoft can review game clips for violations of the&#13;
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" href="https://www.xbox.com/legal/codeofconduct">Microsoft Code of Conduct</a>, even if your game clip sharing setting is set to Block.&#13;
</p><p><strong>Xbox Live Rewards.</strong> Xbox Live Rewards, available at&#13;
    <a target="_blank" class="mscom-link" title="rewards.xbox.com" href="https://rewards.xbox.com/">rewards.xbox.com</a>, is a program you can join to receive Xbox credits for being active on the services. You must agree to receive promotional communications from the Rewards program as a condition of joining.

</p><p><strong>Children and online safety. </strong>If you have children who use Xbox services, you can set up child accounts for them. Children 17 and younger cannot create an account on Xbox Live without parental consent. Adults in the family can change consent choices and online safety settings for child accounts on&#13;
