<p>The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates collaborative, free knowledge websites, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Main Page">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="commons:Main Page">Wikimedia Commons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Main Page">Wiktionary</a>.</p>
<p>This Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information.</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect very little personal information about you.</li>
<li>We do not rent or sell your information to third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using Wikimedia Sites, you consent to this Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="mobile-float-reset mobile-padding-reset">
<p>The Wikimedia movement is founded on a simple, but powerful principle: we can do more together than any of us can do alone. We cannot work collectively without gathering, sharing, and analyzing information about our users as we seek new ways to make the Wikimedia Sites more useable, safer, and more beneficial.</p>
<p>We believe that information-gathering and use should go hand-in-hand with transparency. This Privacy Policy explains how the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization that hosts the Wikimedia Sites, like Wikipedia, collects, uses, and shares information we receive from you through your use of the Wikimedia Sites. It is essential to understand that, by using any of the Wikimedia Sites, you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. That means that reading this Policy carefully is important.</p>
<p>We believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement. You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a standard account or contribute content to the Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p><ins id="donotsell"/>We do not sell or rent your nonpublic information, nor do we give it to others to sell you anything. We use it to figure out how to make the Wikimedia Sites more engaging and accessible, to see which ideas work, and to make learning and contributing more fun. Put simply: we use this information to make the Wikimedia Sites better for you.</p>
<p>After all, it's people like you, the champions of free knowledge, who make it possible for the Wikimedia Sites to not only exist, but also grow and thrive.</p>

<p>Because everyone (not just lawyers) should be able to easily understand how and why their information is collected and used, we use common language instead of more formal terms throughout this Policy.

<p>This section is part of the Privacy Policy and is meant to explain in detail which situations are not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<dl>
<dt><big>Wikimedia Sites with alternative policies</big></dt>
<dd>Some Wikimedia Foundation websites have alternative privacy policies or provisions that differ from this Privacy Policy. These websites include:

</dd>
<dd>These websites, and others like them, will provide a link to their privacy policy (if it stands alone) or to an explanation of any differing provisions (if the site's policy is based on this Privacy Policy).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><big>Community members</big></dt>
<dd>The Wikimedia Sites are collaborative labors of love that are constantly maintained and updated by a global community of volunteers. As a result, some volunteers have access to certain nonpublic information, and use of that information may not be governed by this Privacy Policy. Examples include:
<ul>
<li><b>Administrative volunteers</b>, such as <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/CheckUser" class="extiw" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/CheckUser">CheckUsers</a> or <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Stewards" class="extiw" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/Stewards">Stewards</a>. These are volunteers who enforce Wikimedia Site policies and ensure the safety of the Wikimedia Sites. When these administrators access nonpublic information, they are required to comply with our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Access_to_nonpublic_information_policy" class="extiw" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/Access to nonpublic information policy">Access to Nonpublic Information Policy</a>, as well as other, tool-specific policies.</li>
<li><b>Tool providers</b>. We support platforms for third-party developers to experiment and develop new tools and sites, such as <a class="external text" href="//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia">Labs wmflabs.org</a>. When you use one of the tools developed by these volunteers, you may transfer information to them. When these volunteers access nonpublic information, they are required to comply with the terms governing the particular platform the tool is available on.</li>
<li><b>Other users</b>. We provide several tools that allow users to communicate with each other. The communications may be covered by this Policy while they pass through our systems, but the users who receive these communications, and what they do with the communications once they receive them, are not covered by this Policy. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>posting to Foundation-hosted email lists;</li>
<li>requesting support from volunteers through our <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/OTRS" class="extiw" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/OTRS">online ticketing system</a> (email sent to info[at]wikimedia.org goes to this system);</li>
<li>emailing other users through the Wikimedia Sites (for example, by using the "Email this user" feature); and</li>
<li>chatting on <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/IRC" class="extiw" title="m:Special:MyLanguage/IRC">IRC</a> (such as on the #wikipedia channel).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><big>Third parties</big></dt>
<dd>This Privacy Policy only covers the way the WMF collects and handles information. Third parties who might receive information when you use the Wikimedia Sites may include:
<ul>
<li><b>Service providers</b> whom we may use to help provide our services to you. For example, our actions regarding your information on <a class="external text" href="//blog.wikimedia.org">our blog</a> are covered by this Privacy Policy, but if our blog were hosted by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="//wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, WordPress may also collect information sent automatically by your browser or through cookies that they set. If you are curious about any third-party provider's privacy practices, you should refer directly to their privacy policy.</li>
<li><b>Websites run by other organizations</b>, like websites linked to from the "References" sections of Wikipedia, or run by Wikimedia chapters or other <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:Recognizing_Models_of_Affiliations" class="extiw" title="foundation:Resolution:Recognizing Models of Affiliations">movement organizations</a>. These organizations may receive information from you if you visit their websites after using one of the Wikimedia Sites. They are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
<li><b>Mobile applications provided by other organizations or individuals</b>. These organizations or individuals may receive information from you if you use those applications to access the Wikimedia Sites or Wikimedia Site content. They are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
<li><b>Third-party data-collecting tools</b> that are placed on Wikimedia Sites by volunteers or other third parties. Sometimes, volunteers may place a data-collecting tool, such as a script, gadget, tracking pixel, or share button, on a Wikimedia Site without our knowledge. This Policy does not cover how third parties handle the information they receive as a result of such a tool. If you come across such a third-party tool, and you believe it violates this Policy, you can remove the tool yourself, or report it to privacy[at]wikimedia.org so we can investigate.</li>

<div class="mobile-float-reset mobile-padding-reset">
<p>The Wikimedia Sites were primarily created to help you share your knowledge with the world, and we share your contributions because you have asked us to do so.</p>
<p>When you make a contribution to any Wikimedia Site, including on user or discussion pages, you are creating a permanent, public record of every piece of content added, removed, or altered by you. The page history will show when your contribution or deletion was made, as well as your username (if you are signed in) or your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a> (if you are not signed in). We may use your public contributions, either aggregated with the public contributions of others or individually, to create new features or data-related products for you or to learn more about how the Wikimedia Sites are used.</p>
<p>Unless this Policy says otherwise, you should assume that information that you actively contribute to the Wikimedia Sites, including personal information, is publicly visible and can be found by search engines. Like most things on the Internet, anything you share may be copied and redistributed throughout the Internet by other people. Please do not contribute any information that you are uncomfortable making permanently public, like revealing your real name or location in your contributions.</p>
<p>You should be aware that specific data made public by you or aggregated data that is made public by us can be used by anyone for analysis and to infer information about users, such as which country a user is from, political affiliation, and gender.</p>

<p><ins id="noaccount"/> If you want to create a <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/FAQ#standardaccount" title="Privacy policy/FAQ">standard account</a>, in most cases we require only a username and a password.

Your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a> is also automatically submitted to us, and we record it temporarily to help prevent abuse. No other personal information is required: no name, no email address, no date of birth, no credit card information.</p>
<p>Once created, user accounts cannot be removed entirely (although you can usually hide the information on your user page if you choose to). This is because your public contributions must be associated with their author (you!). So make sure you pick a name that you will be comfortable with for years to come.</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of the demographics of our users, to localize our services, and to learn how we can improve our services, we may ask you for more demographic information, such as gender or age, about yourself. We will tell you if such information is intended to be public or private, so that you can make an informed decision about whether you want to provide us with that information. Providing such information is always completely optional. If you don't want to, you don't have to—it's as simple as that.</p>

<div class="mobile-float-reset mobile-padding-reset">
<p>Because of how browsers work and similar to other major websites, we receive some information automatically when you visit the Wikimedia Sites. This information includes the type of device you are using (possibly including unique device identification numbers, for some beta versions of our mobile applications), the type and version of your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Browsers" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">browser</a>, your browser's language preference, the type and version of your device's <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Operating_System" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">operating system</a>, in some cases the name of your internet service provider or mobile carrier, the website that referred you to the Wikimedia Sites, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to the Wikimedia Sites.</p>
<p>Put simply, we use this information to enhance your experience with Wikimedia Sites. For example, we use this information to administer the sites, provide greater security, and fight vandalism; optimize mobile applications, customize content and set language preferences, test features to see what works, and improve performance; understand how users interact with the Wikimedia Sites, track and study use of various features, gain understanding about the demographics of the different Wikimedia Sites, and analyze trends.</p>

So we want to be as clear as we can about why we use these methods and the type of information we collect with them.</p>
<p>Depending on which technology we use, locally stored data can be anything from text, pictures, and whole articles (as we explain further below) to personal information (like your <a href="/wiki/Privacy_policy/Glossary_of_key_terms#Internet_Protocol_Address" title="Privacy policy/Glossary of key terms">IP address</a>) and information about your use of the Wikimedia Sites (like your username or the time of your visit).</p>
<p>We use this information to make your experience with the Wikimedia Sites safer and better, to gain a greater understanding of user preferences and their interaction with the Wikimedia Sites, and to generally improve our services. We will never use third-party cookies, unless we get your permission to do so.

<p>Locally stored data, JavaScript, and tracking pixels help us do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide you with a personalized experience, such as using cookies to know your language preference, to remember the user preferences you set so we can provide you with the customized look and feel that you want, and to tell you about interesting Wikimedia issues and events in your area.</li>
<li>Deliver more relevant content to you faster. For example, we may use local storage to store your most recently read articles directly on your device, so they can be retrieved quickly. Also, we may use cookies to learn about the topics searched so that we can optimize the search results we deliver to you.</li>
<li>Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites, so that we know what works and what is useful. For example, we might use cookies to learn about the list of articles you are following on your watchlist so that we can recommend similar articles that you may be interested in.</li>
<li>Understand how you use the Wikimedia Sites across different devices, so that we can make our varied Wikimedia Sites more efficient and effective for you.</li>

<p>Wikimedia Sites are collaborative, with users writing most of the policies and selecting from amongst themselves people to hold certain administrative rights.

They use this access to help protect against vandalism and abuse, fight harassment of other users, and generally try to minimize disruptive behavior on the Wikimedia Sites.

These user-selected administrative groups are accountable to other users through checks and balances: users are selected through a community-driven process and overseen by their peers through a logged history of their actions.
